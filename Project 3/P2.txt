The principle employed in this algorithms is based directly in the binary search algorithms.

Time Complexity:
O(log(n)) as the number of iterations we perform, i.e. recursive depth, follows the rule of recursive_depth^2 = n. Thus if we isolate the number of iterations in relation to the input space (n), we obtain log(n) = recursive_depth.

Space Complexity:
O(1) as it is independent of the input.
