This problem is focused on the development of the of a trie a data structure derived from a tree, suited for a good ratio between time and space complexity.


Time Complexity:
O(a*n) Because for the trie, searching and inserting from a trie depends on the length of the word a that is being searched for, inserted, and the number of total words, n.

Space Complexity:
O(n), the worst case would be when we have a word (or words), with no common characters between them, hence having, a node for each letter.
