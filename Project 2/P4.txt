Recursion is used because we don't know how many groups deep we will have to search.
The 'or' operator is used on the output so that it only takes one call to report True for the output to be True.

The time complextity of:
1) is_user_in_group():
   O(n) as two separate for loops that are used.

The space complexity of:
1) is_user_in_group():
   O(1) as only one variable is used.

The space complexity of recursive call stack is proportinal to maximum depth of recursion tree generated. So the space complexity will be O(n).
