Recursion is used because we don't know how many groups deep we will have to search.
The 'or' operator is used on the output so that it only takes one call to report True for the output to be True.

The time complextity of:
1) is_user_in_group():
   O(mn) where m-> depth and n-> number of users.

The space complexity of:
1) is_user_in_group():
   O(mn) since in the worst case, we could have n users, and have to search in full depth being m.
