Recursion is used because it is not known to us how deep the file structure is. And try-except is used to keep the program running even if test directory is not found.

The time complexity of find_files():
O(mn) because of the loop over all files includes number of sub-directories m, and number of files per directory n.

The space complexity of find_files():
O(mn)since in the worse case, we could have n files to hold, and m sub-directories to search.
