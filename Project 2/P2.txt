Recursion because it is not known to us how deep the file structure is.

The time complexity of find_files() is O(n) as it is not known to us how deep the file structure is.
The space complexity of find_files() is O(n) as a variable is allocated for the number of files in the directory.

The space complexity of recursive call stack is proportinal to maximum depth of recursion tree generated. So the computation will grow linearly and the space complexity will be O(n).
