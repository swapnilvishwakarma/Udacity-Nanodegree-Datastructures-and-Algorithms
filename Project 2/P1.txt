Hash map is used to store the cache values.
Doubly linked list to keep track of the most recently used values and size.

Time complexity of:
1) get()
   O(1) as there is no loop used.
2) set()
   O(1) as there is no loop used.

Space complexity of:
1) get()
   O(1) as only one variable is allocated.
2) set()
   O(n) since the dictionary is as large as the amount of keys.
