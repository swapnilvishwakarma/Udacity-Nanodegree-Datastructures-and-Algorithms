Here doubly linked list is used to track the previous and the next block. Since a single block contains the hash of previous and next block along with its own data, therefore any tampering with any of the block changes the entire hashing. And this hash info is also quite unique as it contains the time stamp in it.

The time complextity of:
1) add_block is:
   O(1) as the function occurs in constant time.

The space complexity of:
1) add_block is:
   O(1) as the function allocates a single variable every time.
